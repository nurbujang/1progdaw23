Figure out what the variable should look like, the type of distribution for each, and relationship between the variable (what is the reasonable model of the real-world phenomenon, and how it would be distributed).\n",

    "### Monoclonal Antibodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the most profitable therapeutic proteins on the market (Ho et al., 2013). Some examples of mAbs are DARZALEX® (daratumumab) by Johnson & Johnson for multiple myeloma (Content Lab U.S., 2015), ZIRABEV™ (bevacizumab-bvzr), RUXIENCE™ (rituximab-pvvr) and TRAZIMERA™ (trastuzumab-qyyp) by Pfizer for cancer (www.pfizer.com, 2020) and  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) by Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) for cancer treatment (MSD Connect UK, 2022). MAbs are highly specific and each only binds to a specific protein on a cell (www.cancerresearchuk.org, 2021). Depending on the target protein, it will either attack cancer cells directly, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body's immune system or deliver toxins straight to cancer cells (Mayo Clinic, 2019, Malik and Ghatol, 2023). Patient therapy requires high doses of mAbs over a long period of time (Li et al., 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monoclonal Antibody Production Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Schofield (2023), current commercial mAb manufacturing methods are hybridoma technique, phage display, single B cell technology and recombinant DNA technology, with the latter being the most popular. Recombinant monoclonal antibody mass-production involves inserting select functional gene regions into expression vector into mammalian or bacterial cell cultures (Schofield, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, DeLuca, Mick and DeLuca (2022) reported a method to produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies from human cells at a considerably low cost. However, currently, the currently preferred host for recombinant mAb production are Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) mammalian cells due to their ability to produce complex proteins with post-translational modifications, high productivity and ease-of-use in large scale cell culture (Eberle, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Large-scale Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody Manufacturing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Vázquez-Rey and Lang (2011), a standard recombinant mAb manufacturing process using mammalian cell culture includes growing seed culture (inoculum) in fermentation tanks, followed by large-scale production of up to 20,000 L in bioreactors, cell harvest/primary recovery, product purification and finally product formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the increasing demand in human and animal therapy, new strategies and technologies are continually being developed to maximize cell culture productivity (Rodrigues et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2015, Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). This includes upgraded bioreactors with higher capacities (Rodrigues et al., 2009), disposable bioreactors (Zhao et al., 2014) and advances in proteomics to produce high quality mAbs (Steinhoff et al., 2016, Jyothilekshmi and Jayaprakash, 2021). \n",

    "### Optimization of CHO Cell Culture Productivity in Bioreactors\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Rodrigues et al. (2009), factors that affect cell production are\n",
    "temperature, pH, osmolarity, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrient and metabolites concentration and Glycosylation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALthough CHO cells are usually grown at 37°C (Becerra et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019),  temperature shift (TS) to a hypothermic condition of 25–35°C have been shown to improve protein productivity and quality (Al-Fageeh and Smales, 2006). Fan et al. (2010) and Kou et al. (2011) reported 3-fold and 5-fold increase of mAb productivity at  30°C compared to that of 37°C. Meanwhile, Jenkins and Hovey (1993) reported significantly increased protein yield from CHO cells at alternating temperatures between 39°C and 34°C. \n",

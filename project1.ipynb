    "> Using numpy.random package, generate at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",

    ">  Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. Figure out what the variable should look like, the type of distribution for each, and relationship between the variable (what is the reasonable model of the real-world phenomenon, and how it would be distributed).\n",

    "### Monoclonal Antibodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the most profitable therapeutic proteins on the market (Ho et al., 2013). Some examples of mAbs are DARZALEX® (daratumumab) by Johnson & Johnson for multiple myeloma (Content Lab U.S., 2015), ZIRABEV™ (bevacizumab-bvzr), RUXIENCE™ (rituximab-pvvr) and TRAZIMERA™ (trastuzumab-qyyp) by Pfizer for cancer (www.pfizer.com, 2020) and  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) by Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) for cancer treatment (MSD Connect UK, 2022). MAbs are highly specific and each only binds to a specific protein on a cell (www.cancerresearchuk.org, 2021). Depending on the target protein, it will either attack cancer cells directly, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body's immune system or deliver toxins straight to cancer cells (Mayo Clinic, 2019, Malik and Ghatol, 2023). Patient therapy requires high doses of mAbs over a long period of time (Li et al., 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monoclonal Antibody Production Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Schofield (2023), current commercial mAb manufacturing methods are hybridoma technique, phage display, single B cell technology and recombinant DNA technology, with the latter being the most popular. Recombinant monoclonal antibody mass-production involves inserting select functional gene regions into expression vector into mammalian or bacterial cell cultures (Schofield, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, DeLuca, Mick and DeLuca (2022) reported a method to produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies from human cells at a considerably low cost. However, currently, the most popular choice for recombinant mAb production are Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) mammalian cells due to their ability to produce complex proteins with post-translational modifications, high productivity and ease-of-use in large scale cell culture (Eberle, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Large-scale Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody Manufacturing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Vázquez-Rey and Lang (2011), a standard recombinant mAb manufacturing process using mammalian cell culture includes growing seed culture (inoculum) in fermentation tanks, followed by large-scale production of up to 20,000 L in bioreactors, cell harvest/primary recovery, product purification and finally product formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the increasing demand in human and animal therapy, new strategies and technologies are continually being developed to maximize cell culture productivity (Rodrigues et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2015, Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). This includes nigger, upgraded bioreactors, (Rodrigues et al., 2009)\n",

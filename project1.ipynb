    "### Monoclonal Antibodies\n",
    "\n",
    "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the most profitable therapeutic proteins on the market (Ho et al., 2013). Some examples of mAbs are DARZALEX® (daratumumab) by Johnson & Johnson for multiple myeloma (Content Lab U.S., 2015), ZIRABEV™ (bevacizumab-bvzr), RUXIENCE™ (rituximab-pvvr) and TRAZIMERA™ (trastuzumab-qyyp) by Pfizer for cancer (www.pfizer.com, 2020) and  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) by Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) for cancer treatment (MSD Connect UK, 2022). MAbs are highly specific and each only binds to a specific protein on a cell (www.cancerresearchuk.org, 2021). Depending on the target protein, it will either attack cancer cells directly, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body's immune system or deliver toxins straight to cancer cells (Mayo Clinic, 2019, Malik and Ghatol, 2023). Patient therapy requires high doses of mAbs over a long period of time (Li et al., 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monoclonal Antibody Production Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Schofield (2023), current commercial mAb manufacturing methods are hybridoma technique, phage display, single B cell technology and recombinant DNA technology, with the latter being the most popular. Recombinant monoclonal antibody mass-production involves inserting select functional gene regions into expression vector into mammalian or bacterial cell cultures (Schofield, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, DeLuca, Mick and DeLuca (2022) reported a method to produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies from human cells at a considerably low cost. However, currently, the currently preferred host for recombinant mAb production are Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) mammalian cells due to their ability to produce complex proteins with post-translational modifications, high productivity and ease-of-use in large scale cell culture (Eberle, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Large-scale Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody Manufacturing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Vázquez-Rey and Lang (2011), a standard recombinant mAb manufacturing process using mammalian cell culture includes growing seed culture (inoculum) in fermentation tanks, followed by large-scale production of up to 20,000 L in bioreactors, cell harvest/primary recovery, product purification and finally product formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the increasing demand in human and animal therapy, new strategies and technologies are continually being developed to maximize cell culture productivity (Rodrigues et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2015, Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). This includes upgraded bioreactors with higher capacities (Rodrigues et al., 2009), disposable bioreactors (Zhao et al., 2014) and advances in proteomics to produce high quality mAbs (Steinhoff et al., 2016, Jyothilekshmi and Jayaprakash, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization of CHO Cell Culture Conditions in Bioreactors\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Rodrigues et al. (2009), factors that affect cell production are temperature, pH, osmolality, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nutrient and metabolites concentration. Optimized temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrient and metabolites concentration are growth factors for CHO cells while high osmolality and lactate inhibit cell growth. Attributes of specific protein productivity include cell size, cell volume and viable cell density (Alhuthali, Kotidis and Kontoravdi, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial for these culture conditions to be optimized to maintain a consistent glycosylation profile, which is a critical protein quality trait to ensure proper protein conformation and maintain product integrity and efficacy (Masayoshi Onitsuka et al., 2014, Jennewein and Alter, 2017, Li et al., 2010, 2019, 2022, Reddy et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Li et al. (2022) stressed the importance of optimization throughout all stages of genetic modification, expression vector, cell line modification finally production process in recombinant protein production, in this study, I will only focus on the optimization of cell growth conditions in a miniature bioreactor model. For this purpose, I will select four major determinants in cell growth; temperature, dissolved oxygen, glucose concentration and lactate concentration. The dependent variable is final viable cell density (VCD). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors Affecting CHO Cell Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Temperature**\n",
    "\n",
    "ALthough CHO cells are usually grown at 37°C (Becerra et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019),  temperature shift (TS) to a hypothermic condition of 25–35°C have been shown produce cell growth (Al-Fageeh et al., 2006). Fan et al. (2010) and Kou et al. (2011) reported 3-fold and 5-fold increase of mAb productivity at  30°C compared to that of 37°C. Meanwhile, Jenkins and Hovey (1993) reported significantly increased protein yield from CHO cells at alternating temperatures between 34°C and 39°C. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dissolved Oxygen**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Zakrzewski, Lee and Lye (2022), fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) tension between 10%–30% decreased cell growth by 35%. Fluctuations in DO resulted in increased lactate accumulation (Hippach et al., 2018). Restelli et al. (2006) found that under hyperoxic condition of 200% DO, the final viable cell yield was significantly lower than normoxic condition at 50% DO. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Glucose Concentration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dowd, Kwok and Piret (2001) and Meuwly et al. (2006) proposed the use of glucose consumption rate (GCR) as a process monitoring tool to indicate medium utilization in cell cultures in bioreactors. López-Meza et al., (2016) found that recombinant CHO cells did not exhibit a lag-phase even at the lowest glucose concentration. Vergara et al. (2018) later reported that high feed glucose limits cell growth, but improves specific protein productivity in CHO cells significantly. Hence, it is important to find the right balance during the optimization process of recombinant cell production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lactate Concentration**\n",
    "\n",
    "While lactate is a waste product of cell growth and high levels of lactate has negative effects on cell growth (Zhou et al., 2011), Li et al. (2011) found that incorporating lactate in the culture medium could be beneficial in minimizing ammonia accumulation, thus improving cell culture performance. Zagari et al. (2013) reported that high lactate reduces mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cells. According to Martínez-Monge et al. (2019), CHO cells can metabolize both glucose and lactate during the growth phase. The lactate metabolic shift from lactate production to consumption does not happen in cultures with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (Brunner et al., 2018).\n",
